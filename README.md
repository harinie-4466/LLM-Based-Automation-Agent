# LLM-Based-Automation-Agent
This repository contains an automation agent that processes plain-English tasks and executes them using a combination of deterministic logic and a Large Language Model (LLM). The agent is designed to integrate into a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline to automate routine tasks for DataWorks Solutions.
